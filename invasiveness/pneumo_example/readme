Pneumo lineage vs. serotype effect
Logistic mixed effects model with serotype as fixed effect and lineage as random effect

Outcome is binary disease / carriage, 

Build a model with two hierarchical levels: serotypes as fixed effects and lineage as random effect
Take also the country into account (USA / South-Africa)

R version 4.5.1 and packages typical install time <15mins
Expected runtime <1min

Input file https://github.com/rgladstone/EC-K-typing/blob/main/invasiveness/pneumo_example/NT_update_Pneumo_lineage_invasiveness.csv 
Heatmat output: https://github.com/rgladstone/EC-K-typing/blob/main/invasiveness/pneumo_example/pnuemococcal_heatmap.top50.lineages.serotype.pdf

To run the model on your own data, replace the above input file with the same column headers and equivalent metadata
Make sure that your data are representative snapshots of the bacterial population for a given country and time period.
