Date,K-locus,Action,Reason,,
08/04/2025,KL137_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL14 as KL137_v1. KL137_v1 differed from KL14 by a disrupted vatD. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant. ,,
08/04/2025,KL114_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL2 as KL114_v1. KL114_v1 group97 is an allele of kslC that was not clustered with kslC due to a disrupted mosaic of kslC and group97 in KL53_v1.,,
08/04/2025,KL53_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL2 as KL53_v1. KL53_v1 differs from KL2 by a disrupted kslC/group97 gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant. ,,
08/04/2025,KL140_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL7 as KL140_v1. KL140_v1 differs from KL7 due to a disrupted rffE gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL189_v1,removed from database,"Frequent mistyping of KL52 as KL189_v1. KL189_v1 was only observed once in a low-quality assembly which could have  misassemblies, it has an insertion of two genes and kpsT is split. As it has not been seen in other isolates and is interferring with correctly tying the common KL7 it has been removed.",,
08/04/2025,KL37_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL7 as KL37_v1. KL37_v1 differs from KL7 due to a disrupted group195 gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL89_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL7 as KL89_v1. KL89_v1 differed from KL7 by an IS and a truncation of group30 gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL18_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL2 as KL18_v1. KL18_v1 differed from KL2 by disruption of the kslD gene. Both KL2 and KL18_v1 phenotype as K2. If any subsequenct phenotypic difference is discovered it can be included with Kaptive logic making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL87_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL12 as KL87_v1. KL87_v1 differed from KL12 by a disruption of the group77 gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL107_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL4 as KL107_v1. KL107_v1 differs from KL4 by an IS element and a disruption of the kfoB gene. This can be captured with Kaptive logic once any phenotypic difference is known making inclusion in the database redundant.,,
08/04/2025,KL31_v1,phenotype removed,Phenotype K74 was reported for 1 NCTC strain but K74 is not considered a K-antigen anymore.,,
08/04/2025,KL150,phenotype removed,Phenotype K98 reported for 1 enterobase strain but KL27 is negative for K98. KL20 was confirmed to K98. ,,
08/04/2025,KL98 (KL20_v1),phenotype added,KL20_v1 strains confirmed to be phenotypically K98.,,
01/09/2025,KL99_v1,removed from database,Frequent mistyping of KL110 as KL99_v1. KL99_v1 differed from KL110 and KL169 by a duplication of  group 154.,,
