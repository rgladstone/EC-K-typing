_E. coli_ Group 2 and Group 3 focused K-typing database formatted for use with the tool Kaptive version 3 https://kaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

K-antigen loci (with and without phenotype). This database is expected to cover the majority of invasive isolates; group 2 and 3 capsule prevalence is near complete in phylogroups B2 and D, whilst phylogroups A, B1, and C have a lower prevalence.

Phenotypes, if known, are given in K-type and serotype fields. 18/26 group 2 phenotypes are represented, and 5/6 group 3 phenotypes are represented.

Currently, known K-type references in group 1 (K102) and group 4 (K9, K38, K84) are included but need to be separated out into a separate version in V2.  

Annotated using prokka 1.14.5 and panaroo 3.1.4 from https://github.com/tseemann/prokka and https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo to give consistent annotation across the DB.

IS-element associated annotations, but not sequence, have been removed. Kaptive V3 is, therefore, required for this version.
Other known non-capsule genes (beta-lactamse) annotations within the K-locus have been removed, but not the sequence.
