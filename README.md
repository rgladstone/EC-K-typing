E. coli Group 2 and Group 3 focused K-typing database formatted for use with the tool Kaptive https://kaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

K-antigen loci (with and without phenotype). This database is expected to cover the majority of invasive isolates; prevalence is near complete in phylogroups B2 and D, and phylogroups A, B1, and C have a lower prevalence.

Currently, known K-type references in group 4 are included but need to be separated out into a separate version in V2.  

Phenotypes if known are given in K-type and serotype fields.

Annotated using prokka 1.14.5 and panaroo 3.1.4 from https://github.com/tseemann/prokka and https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo to give consistent annotation across the DB.

IS-element associated annotations, but not sequence, have been removed.
Other known non-capsule genes (beta-lactamse) annotations within the K-locus have been removed, but not the sequence.
